This is a read note of ‘The special fiber of the motivic deformation of the stable homotopy category is algebraic’. In this note, I give a summary of the theoretical part of this paper: according to the equivalence between some parts of the $E_2$-pages of two spectral sequences the authors found by computation, an equivalence between two $\infty$-categories which induces the equivalence between two spectral sequences is found. This result shows us a new way of computing the differentials in the Adams spectral sequences.
