I am a master student at the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/index.html?lang=en) in [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech), Shenzhen and I expect to graduate in June, 2024. My advisor is [Yifei Zhu](https://yifeizhu.github.io/).

I am interested in algebraic topology, especially the computer-assisted computation of the homotopy groups of spheres. I have learned the chromatic homotopy theory and related topics as well as some knowledge of (mod 2) equvariant homotopy theory, motivic homotopy theory and algebraic K theory. I am currently interested in the topic of computing the unstable $v_2$-homotopy group of (odd) spheres.
