Following the previous talk in SUSTech graduate seminar, we introduce the generalised Adams spectral sequence and show the algorithm of computing $E_2$-pages of classical Adams spectral sequence.(i.e. minimal resolution, Lambda algebra and May spectral sequence) Then, we prove that the ring spectrum structure induces a multiplicative structures on the Adams spectral sequnece as well as show the algorithm of computing it. Finally, we give a brief introduction to the method of computing the differentials in the spectral sequence and the hidden extension, aiming to show the difficulty that we will face in computing stable homotopy groups.
